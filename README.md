# Final Project

## Instructions

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it as a template for your project, and develop your code in the forked repository. After you fork the repository, please enable the issue tracker in the repository settings so that others in the class (including the professor) can provide feedback. To submit the project, send a pull request to the original repository.

Expand on the readme questions below to provide an overview of the goals, background, and challenges for the final project. You can delete the questions as you write text that answers them, or leave the prompts in place. You can also delete this instruction section of you like.

Add all code to your project repository, including shell scripts, R analyses, python, etc.

Do not commit large data files to the repository. Provide paths to where they can be downloaded if they
are from public sources, or track them with [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com).

## Introduction

The Cnidarians are a group who have benefited from developments in sequencing technologies and new species genomes are being published with increasing frequency.  To better understand both the unique features and the relationships within this group it will be beneficial to understand the quality of these various genomes.

## The goal

The goal of this project is to survey the quality of Cnidarian genomes and then compare size, heterozygosity, and frequency of repeats.

## The data

Data used in the project will be from published genomes available online. If required, any extra data will be requested from the original authors.

## Background

Motivation for the project....

How it fits in with other work...

What the reader needs to know to understand the project


## Methods
Read papers and find information to determine their, methodology, size, repeat content, Contigs, Scaffold N50, NG50.
Rerun BUSCO on each of the genomes.  
Analyze and compare data.
